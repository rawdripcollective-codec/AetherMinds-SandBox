            <h2>Our Core Innovation: The Planner-Solver-Critic (PSC) Architecture</h2>
            <div class="features-grid">

                    <h3>The Planner</h3>
                    <p>Acts as the AI's strategist, intelligently deconstructing complex user prompts into actionable, multi-step sub-tasks. It orchestrates the entire agentic workflow, determining the optimal sequence of operations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="icon">🛠️</div>
                    <h3>The Solver</h3>
                    <p>These are the AI's specialized tools. The Solver executes specific <code>SimpleToolExecutor</code> modules (modular mini-apps or device functions) to complete each step of the Planner's plan, leveraging the device's native capabilities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="icon">🛡️</div>
                    <h3>The Critic</h3>
                    <p>The AI's crucial quality control and safety mechanism. It continuously evaluates the Planner's decisions and the Solver's outputs for accuracy, safety, and efficiency. The Critic learns from mistakes, enabling adaptive 'self-healing' systems.</p>

            <h2>Key Differentiating Features</h2>
            <div class="features-grid">
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="icon">🔒</div>
                    <h3>Local-First AI & Privacy by Design</h3>
                    <p>All core AI inference and reasoning happen directly on the user's mobile device. This ensures unparalleled data privacy, as sensitive information never leaves the device for cloud processing. GDPR, HIPAA, and other compliance built-in from day one.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="icon">🚀</div>
                    <h3>Zero Marginal Cost & Low Latency</h3>
                    <p>By executing Large Language Models (LLMs) locally via Ollama integration, there are no per-token API fees, making advanced AI ubiquitous and affordable. Processing on-device also eliminates network latency, providing lightning-fast responses.</p>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="icon">🌐</div>
                    <h3>Fully Functional Offline Mode</h3>
                    <p>Since AI models and processing reside on the device, AetherMinds™-powered applications function completely even without an internet connection. Essential for field agents, remote locations, and robust user experience.</p>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="icon">🌱</div>
                    <h3>Self-Healing Agent Systems</h3>
                    <p>Leveraging the Critic's feedback loop and local LLM adaptation, our agents can dynamically adjust their plans and tool usage based on immediate outcomes. This enables continuous on-device learning and improvement without developer intervention.</p>

                    <h3>Hyper-Personalized "Digital Twin" Agents</h3>
                    <p>By learning user habits, preferences, and context entirely locally, AetherMinds™ can create a truly personalized AI assistant that anticipates needs, manages complex schedules, and offers proactive, private support with unmatched accuracy and trust.</p>

                    <h3>Real-time On-Device "Code Interpreter" (Future)</h3>
                    <p>An advanced feature allowing the AI agent to dynamically create new tools or adapt existing ones in response to novel problems. The local LLM could generate and safely execute scripts within a sandboxed environment, offering unprecedented flexibility.</p>
